      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>Western Printing & Lithographing Co., later known as Western Publishing, was founded in Racine in the early 20th century. It became best known for producing the Little Golden Books, a series of affordable and beautifully illustrated children's books that shaped generations of young readers. At its height, Western Publishing was a national leader in children's literature, comics, puzzles, and educational materials. Its contributions to American culture—especially mid-century childhood—were significant.</p>

      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>Knowing the original owner and purpose behind a home brings a new depth of appreciation. This house wasn’t just another postwar build—it was crafted for someone with stature in one of Racine’s most influential companies. The design reflects a mid-century blend of practicality and distinction, suited for a respected community figure. If walls could talk, they’d speak of editorial meetings, publishing milestones, and Racine’s vibrant mid-century heyday.</p>
