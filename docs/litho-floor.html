    <p>
      You may find this fascinating: the floor of the downstairs barroom is crafted from vintage zinc lithographic plates once used in the printing process at Western Printing & Litho Co. These plates once bore the inked impressions of comic books, soap packaging, and beer labels‚Äîand now line the floor in a truly one-of-a-kind historical installation.

    <div class="accordion">üîç About Elmer G. Voigt & Western Publishing</div>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        Elmer G. Voigt was a longtime production manager at Western Printing & Litho Co. in Racine, Wisconsin. Western Publishing became one of the most influential printing companies in America, known for publishing Golden Books, Whitman comics, and coloring books, among many other titles.

    <div class="accordion">üß± What Are Lithographic Plates?</div>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        These are zinc printing plates used in offset lithography. Once etched with artwork and text, they transferred ink to paper in mass production runs. The plates on the floor feature reversed images, brand marks, and fine graphic detail‚Äîevidence of their original industrial purpose.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion">üßº What‚Äôs on the Floor?</div>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        Some of the plates show soap labels, such as "Famous Skin Toilet Soap" with ornate typography, while others advertise regional beers like "Exley Munich Bock." The engraved designs are backward‚Äîjust as they would have appeared when printing.
      </p>

    <div class="accordion">üìú The History Behind the Stone</div>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        Letters from 1936 and 1954, addressed to Mr. Voigt, describe the sourcing of lithographic stones from quarries near Solnhofen, Germany. These historic stones were known for their smooth, fossil-rich surfaces‚Äîideal for printing. The tradition eventually evolved from stone to metal plates like the ones now used as flooring in this unique home.

        The home‚Äôs barroom floor isn't just functional‚Äîit's a historical showcase. The floor displays dozens of printing plates, each a glimpse into Wisconsin‚Äôs printing legacy.
