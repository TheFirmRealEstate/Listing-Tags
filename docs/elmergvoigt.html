    You may find this interesting: Elmer G. Voigt wasn’t just the original homeowner—he lived and worked during a remarkable era in Racine’s history. He was a longtime executive at <strong>Western Publishing</strong> (formally known as Western Printing and Lithographing Company), a firm founded right here in Racine in 1907. While Voigt held a local presence, the company grew to national prominence for publishing beloved titles such as the <em>Little Golden Books</em>, and ran offices in New York, Los Angeles, and even had a plant in Poughkeepsie, New York. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

    Western Publishing’s success helped put Racine on the map, and its legacy lives on—Little Golden Books remain an imprint of Penguin Random House, reminding us how this community helped shape popular childhood reading across America. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
