      <h2>About Elmer G. Voigt</h2>
      <p>
        Elmer G. Voigt was the original owner for whom this home was built. A respected figure in Racine, Wisconsin, he spent his career at <strong>Western Publishing</strong>—one of the most iconic printing and publishing firms in American history.
      </p>
      <p>
        Founded in 1907, Western Publishing (also known as Western Printing and Lithographing Company) was headquartered in Racine and became widely known for creating and distributing the beloved <em>Little Golden Books</em>, as well as comic lines and children’s encyclopedias. During its peak, it partnered with giants like Walt Disney and Mattel, helping introduce characters like Barbie and Mickey Mouse into children's literature.
      </p>
      <p>
        The company expanded nationwide but remained proud of its Racine roots—employing generations of workers and playing a major role in local culture and economy. Today, the legacy of Western Publishing lives on through its imprint in Penguin Random House, which continues to publish the cherished Golden Books that Elmer Voigt once helped bring to life.
